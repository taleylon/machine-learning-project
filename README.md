# Machine Learning Project
Machine Learning project, implemented in python, using scikit-learn.<br>
In this project a data set was given, without prior knowledge about what the data represents.<br>
During the project the data was examined, visualized, transformed and fit to several models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and Artificial Neural Networks, which were evaluated
with K-fold cross validation, in order to determine which model would be a best fit for prediction.
