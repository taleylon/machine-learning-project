# machine-learning-project
Machine Learning project, implemented in python, using scikit-learn. In this project a data set was given, without prior knowledge about what the data represents.
During the project the data was examined, visualized, transformed and fit to several models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and Artificial Neural Networks, which were evaluated
with K-fold cross validation, in order to determine which model would be a best fit for prediction.
